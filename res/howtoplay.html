        <h2>Finding Pictures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Pictures menu is where all the pictures you can load are. Hovering over a category will show the names of every picture available from it. Clicking on one will load a new game with it.</li>
            <li>Mosaic already comes with a few nice sets of pictures, but you can load your own if you want.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>After you have loaded a picture, you can start playing. Simply click and drag a piece to move it.</li>
            <li>The object of the game is to rearrange the pieces back into the original picture.</li>
            <li>Your game will save automatically, so you can close and come back to it anytime without losing your progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Loading Your Own Pictures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Loading your own pictures is simple. All you need to do is copy an image file in png, jpeg, or bmp format into any one of the category folders inside of the pictures folder.</li>
            <li>You can choose Pictures > Open Folder for Mosaic to locate this folder for you.</li>
            <li>You must restart Mosaic to see your new pictures.</li>
            <li>Hint: You can create your own category folders!</li>
        </ul>
